**Overview**

Coming into this course, you should already be familiar with
Abstract Data Types and with the way that C++ classes are used
to implement them.


To be certain that everyone is on the same page, however, this
module examines some critical information about ADTs, classes,
templates in C++.  Most of this material should be review for
you.  (If not, you can find more detailed treatments on the
websites for the pre-requisite courses CS250 or CS333.)  But
it may be some time since you have seen it, or, if you are a
recent transfer to ODU, your prior courses might not have
covered all of it.


Because the C++ language is evolving, there may be some code
that looks unfamiliar simply because it takes advantage of the
C++11 standard.
